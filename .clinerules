# AI Agent Instructions for multi-game-engines

## 🛠 Strategic Context
This project utilizes an "AI Ensemble" development model. You are part of a coordinated team of AI tools.

## ⚖️ Rules of Engagement
1. **Never use `any`**. Strict type safety is mandatory.
2. **Use Branded Types**. Wrap domain strings (FEN, SFEN, Move) in branded types. Always validate via factories.
3. **Pre-compile Regex**. Store Regex as `static readonly` for performance.
4. **SRI Integrity**. All resource loads must have SRI hashes.
5. **AI Workflow**. Follow `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md`. Use CodeRabbit for self-audit.
6. **Graceful Degradation**. If rate-limited, fallback to high-intensity local analysis (`pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`).

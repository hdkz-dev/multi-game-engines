# Decision Log (DECISION_LOG.md)

This document is an index to the ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) that record the major design decisions of the project. Please refer to individual files for details.

> **Note (2026-02-19)**: ADR-003 to ADR-013 were assigned during the early design phase but were absorbed or superseded by later integrations (e.g., ADR-014 to ADR-026). These numbers are currently skipped to maintain historical integrity.

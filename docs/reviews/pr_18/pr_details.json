This PR elevates the architecture to the 2026 ultimate standards by implementing advanced reliability, observability, and safety patterns.

### Key Enhancements

- **Atomic Initialization**: Refined 'EngineBridge' with a 'loaderPromise' pattern to prevent redundant resource loading.
- **Protocol Security Refinement**: Tailored sanitization for USI/GTP protocols (e.g., preserving SGF semicolons in Go).
- **Zero-Any Completeness**: Fully adhered to the Zero-Any policy across core and all adapters.

### Verification

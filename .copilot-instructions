# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Coding Standards
- Language: TypeScript (NodeNext)
- Monorepo: pnpm workspaces
- Principle: Pure Core + Specialized Adapters
- Casing: CamelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes/interfaces.

## Prohibited Patterns
- **NO `any`**: Strictly use `unknown`.
- **NO Generic Error**: Use `EngineError` from `@multi-game-engines/core`.
- **NO Sanitization**: Use "Refuse by Exception" for protocol commands.

## Architecture Context
- `IEngine` is the public facade.
- `IEngineAdapter` is the internal implementation.
- Domain types (`FEN`, `Move`) are branded types.

## Verification
Ensure all code passes `pnpm run ai:check`.

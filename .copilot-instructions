# GitHub Copilot Instructions for multi-game-engines

## Coding Standards
- Prohibit the use of `any`. Use specific types or `unknown`.
- Ensure all domain strings (e.g., FEN, Move) are handled through Branded Types and validated by factory functions.
- Optimize for high NPS (Nodes Per Second) by pre-compiling Regular Expressions as `static readonly` class members.
- Implement "Refuse by Exception" for security validation.

## Architectural Context
- Follow the Facade/Adapter pattern.
- Refer to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for overall design.
- Sync changes with `docs/PROGRESS.md` and `docs/TECHNICAL_SPECS.md`.

## Quality Assurance
- Use the AI Ensemble workflow defined in `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md`.
- Prefer `vitest` for unit testing.
- Ensure all new features have corresponding tests in `src/__tests__`.
